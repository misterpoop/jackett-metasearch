Jackett has a thing called “Manual Search” which is used to manually search on multiple trackers without automation tools such as sonarr or radarr, similar to certain torrent search engines like torrentz.
I have modified Jackett’s index.html and made following changes:
1.	Load the manual search automatically when the page is opened (onload=showSearch())
2.	Remove pretty much all the other html stuff (except for the scripts)
3.	Hidden “DL Factor”,”UL Factor” and “Grabs” from the search result table using CSS
4.	Remove X button and Close button from manual search
5.	Made the search box a bit bigger (searchquery textbox)

I have near zero web development knowledge so I haven’t modified anything more. I haven’t touched internal Javascript.
I really needed a way to search torrents from public trackers; I have previously setup a DHT Scraper on my VPS but that just scrapes a ton of garbage. NZBHydra can be used with Jackett for searching content on torrent sites but it adds another unnecessary step as Jackett already has Manual Search built in.
 I would greatly appreciate some help with making this look better and prevent anyone unauthorized from changing the indexers, probably a login button for changing indexers or downloading private torrents.
That said, the search does indeed “work”, you will have to setup all the indexers normally and then modify the index.html in ‘Jackett/Content/’ directory.
